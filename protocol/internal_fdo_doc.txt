Key Atoms

uni, act, if, man, mat, var
de, buf, idb, fm, cm, async
Basic Programming Concepts
if, then, else, while, do, loop
Basics

FDO91 is a collection of atoms which define how things are displayed to a user through the client. The atoms are responsible for creating object and actions that a user interacts with on the client. They are grouped into several different Protocols, defined by a 2-3 letter prefix such as uni and if

Descriptions

Object Creation Atoms Data Extraction, Handling and Storage Atoms Tool Management Atoms General Atoms

Object Creation Atoms

UNI
Responsible for governing the flow of streams
IF
Responsible for allowing the programmer to test conditions
VAR
Responsible for movign data in and out of the client registers
ACT
Responsible for controling the action streams in a form
MAN
Responsible for the structure of forms and creation of objects
MAT
Responsible for setting flags used to define forms created with MAN
Data Extraction, Handling and Storage Atoms

BUF
Used to handle the client buffer system. These buffers hold data sent to the host or stored in main.idx
DE
Works directly with client buffers to extract and store data from objects
IDB
Used to store and retrieve data from main.idx
FM
File Manager. Used to do limited direct Input/Output with the users hard drive
Tool Management Atoms

CM
Manages all the *.tol tools in the /tool/ directory. Verifys tools for TODs and replacements
General Atoms

ASYNC
Handles messageboxes and screen name issues
SM
A collection of shorthand atoms
Programming Concepts

If VAR and IDB Actions MAN Atoms FM Atoms CM and Async While Loops

If

Simple If statement
tests if user is online, if true execute commands down to uni_sync_skip <1>
if false execute commands between uni_sync_skip <1> and uni_sync_skip <2>
uni_start_stream
if_online_then <1, 2>
async_alert <info, "You are online">
uni_sync_skip <1>
async_alert <info, "You are NOT online">
uni_sync_skip <2>
uni_end_stream

Example in VB:
if online=true then
messagebox "You are online"
else
messagebox "You are NOT online"
end if
VAR and IDB

Checks to see if GID 20-0-16 is New User
uni_start_stream
Set context to 20-0-16
idb_set_context <20-0-16>
Set offset to where data is stored
idb_atr_offset <1>
Stores DB value
idb_get_string <>
Loads a register with string value into register A
var_string_set_from_atom <A>
Sets register B to New User
var_string_set <B, "New User">
Kills context to the GID
idb_end_context
Test case of register values
If string A equals string B then (see If statement above)
if_stra_eq_strb_then <1, 2>
async_error_box <"GID 20-0-16 is not New User">
uni_sync_skip <1>
async_error_box <"GID 20-0-16 is New User">
uni_sync_skip <2>
uni_end_stream
Actions

Ussually defined in button actions on a form
When clicked the button will display a message box
Start a button
man_start_object <trigger, "Button">
Starts the action of the object when clicked
act_replace_select_action
<
uni_start_stream
The actions placed here will occur when the button is clicked
async_error_box <"Display message when clicked">
uni_end_stream
>
man_end_object
MAN Atoms

MAN Atoms define attributes for objects.
uni_start_stream
Set attributes for object with relative ID of 3
man_set_context_relative <3>
Get string A
var_string_get <A>
Get the last atom and replace the content of object 3 with string A
uni_use_last_atom_string <man_replace_data>
Update display
man_update_display
Stop setting context for relative ID 3
man_end_context
FM Atoms

Start File Manager protocol
fm_start
Full name path of the ini file
fm_item_type 34
fm_item_set_ascii "Name INI"
fm_item_type 35
Internal group name of the ini file
fm_item_set_ascii "KEY"
Example: sysinfo.ini located in AOL root
CM and Async

Start stream
uni_start_stream
Useful for getting the windows directory
cm_tb_get_windows_dir
Open /aolshare/sysinfo/sinf.exe in the windows directory
sinf.exe is the AOL System Info program
async_exec_app <"aolshare/sysinfo/sinf.exe">
uni_end_stream

This example shows how to create a messagebox using async
uni_start_stream
You can use async_error_box or async_alert to display a messagebox
async_error_box <"This is a messagebox">
or
async_alert <info, "This is a messagebox">
uni_end_stream
While Loops

Example from fdo training packet
uni_start_stream
var_number_set <"0, 0">
var_number_set <"1, 100">
uni_start_loop
if_numa_lt_numb_then <10>
var_numa_increment
man_set_context_relative <1>
var_number_get 0
uni_convert_last_atom_string
uni_use_last_atom_stringproto$display
man_replace_data
man_update_display
man_end_context
uni_end_loop
uni_sync_skip <10>
uni_end_stream

Example in Basic:
A = 0
DO WHILE A < 100
A = A + 1
Edit.1.text = STRA(A)
LOOP
END
Tokens

Most tokens have two parts

Token
A token is a two character ID given to a specific task on the service. Some common examples of tokens would be:
iO Locate A Member
f1 Invoke Database Record (form_edit)
Arguement
An arguement is the second part of most tokens, it tells AOL what you want the task to do.
Common FDO code to use tokens and arguments (sometimes refered to as 'token/args') would be:
uni_start_stream
sm_send_token_arg <"f1", 32-30>
The above example basically says 'Hey AOL! Go fetch me a form_edit form, number 32-30'
Debugging

Using Atomic Debugger to debug your atomic script (FDO91 streams)
There are two basic ways to debug your script. Go to either Setup Options or Commands > Set breakpoints

From Setup Options choose Setup (Ctrl+Enter), select Decompile Atoms and Single Step, select all Trace Message Selectors
Choose Atom Trace and run your script to begin debugging.

From Commands choose Set breakpoints and select your breakpoints clicking OK afterward. Now follow the steps above to select Singe Step and Atom Trace and start debugging.
